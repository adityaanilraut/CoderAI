"""Cross-platform helpers for restricting file permissions to the owner.

On POSIX we ``chmod``/``fchmod`` files that hold secrets — API keys, OAuth
tokens, and session history — so only the owner can read them. Windows has
neither ``os.fchmod`` (the attribute is absent, so calling it raises
``AttributeError``) nor POSIX permission bits, so these helpers degrade to a
no-op there and rely on the default per-user ACLs of the ``%USERPROFILE%``
profile directory where ``~/.coderAI`` lives.

Using these helpers instead of calling ``os.fchmod``/``os.chmod`` directly
keeps the atomic-write paths (config, history, MCP servers/credentials)
working on Windows instead of crashing mid-save.
